*My City Weather app*

This application was developed by Chintan Patel during Winter 2019 term. The application fetches data from openweathermap API and renders in UI. The user can select desired city name.

API link: https://openweathermap.org/current

I have used json file provided by Openweathermap API to improve easiness of the application. The file is too big and contains data of more than 200,000 cities. Thus, application takes some time (in seconds) while loading first time. Once the file is loaded, it works smoothly.

For some cities, the AutoCompleteTextView may return some city and country name as same. In json, they are different by considering longitudes and latitudes. The issue is explained in the report submitted.

No extra file is required to add with the code submitted to run the application.
